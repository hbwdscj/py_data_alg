# py_data_alg
my python daily data structure and algorithms learning 

Include now :

1. Bag_ADT	

2. Array

3. Linkedlist
	
4. DoubleLinkedlis

5. Queue_ll

6. Queue_array

7. Deque

8. Stack

9. Today did some ubantu thing ,include: ssr, deepin-wine, wechat, gnome- tweak , linux is better than windows for me now ,maybe some days I'll be back to windows for job ,but now I really enjoy coding and playing in ubantu

10. HashTable(for me sometime: 哈希表的hash方法由hash函数来定义，解决hash冲突的方法在python中有定义，load factor >=0.8 时要rehash，rehash方法python中定义，我理解的删除复杂度为O(1),插入复杂度为O(1) )


                         Keep Learning !!
